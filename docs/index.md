# Our mission

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; line-height: 1.6;">

  <p>
    The modern economy is built on complex digital systems like the cloud.
    They are powerful, but painfully hard to operate.
    AI agents promise automation, yet today they fail because they lack
    <strong>operational intelligence</strong>:
    an understanding of how engineered digital systems respond to actions.
  </p>

  <p>
    A simple truth:
    <em>the digital world has no physics</em>,
    but it obeys rules humans wrote down, which gives it meaning.
    APIs, documentation, and traces precisely define how digital systems behave—
    what actions mean, what is allowed, and how failures arise.
    The cloud is one such world, encoded by tens of thousands of APIs.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Our mission</strong> is to synthesize <em>world models</em> for digital systems using AI—
    and use them as training grounds to improve AI’s execution intelligence,
    starting with the cloud.
